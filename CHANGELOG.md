### üîß **June 2025 - Critical Bug Fixes**

#### **Leaderboard Width Layout Fix**
**Issue:** Leaderboard table expanding beyond container bounds, causing page layout breaks

**Solution:**
- Fixed container constraints using viewport width calculations
- Replaced problematic `w-max` classes with proper width constraints
- Added responsive navigation with proper scroll handling
- Ensured table content stays within defined boundaries

**Technical Changes:**
```typescript
// Fixed container constraints
<div className="w-full max-w-[calc(100vw-32px)] mx-auto ... overflow-hidden"
     style={{ maxWidth: 'calc(100vw - 32px)' }}>

// Fixed navigation sections
<div className="overflow-x-auto mb-4 w-full">
  <div className="flex gap-2 min-w-max">
```

#### **Weekly Progress Consecutive Days Fix**
**Issue:** Weekly progress only showing current day instead of all consecutive streak days

**Root Cause:** Core weekly progress calculation was only marking the current day instead of marking all consecutive streak days within the current week.

**Solution:**
- Replaced single-day marking logic with comprehensive consecutive day marking
- Added proper date calculations for marking all streak days in current week
- Enhanced logging for better debugging of streak calculations

**Before vs After:**
- ‚ùå 3-day streak: Shows 1 day marked
- ‚úÖ 3-day streak: Shows 3 days marked (if all in current week)
