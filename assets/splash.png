This is a placeholder for a 1242x2436 pixel PNG splash screen image.

Since this is a binary file, actual binary content cannot be provided in text format.

To create this splash screen:
1. Create a 1242x2436px PNG image
2. Design a simple placeholder splash screen with the Queens Game logo/title centered
3. Use white background color as specified in app.json
4. Ensure the image will look good with "contain" resizeMode
5. Save it as "splash.png" in the assets directory
6. Ensure the file is referenced correctly in app.json (which it already is at "./assets/splash.png")
