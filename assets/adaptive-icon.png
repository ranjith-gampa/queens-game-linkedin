This is a placeholder for a 1024x1024 pixel PNG adaptive icon image for Android.

Since this is a binary file, actual binary content cannot be provided in text format.

To create this adaptive icon:
1. Create a 1024x1024px square PNG image
2. Design a simple icon with a transparent background
3. Ensure the important content is within a safe zone (central 72% of the image)
4. Save it as "adaptive-icon.png" in the assets directory
5. The image will be displayed with the background color (#ffffff) specified in app.json
6. Ensure the file is referenced correctly in app.json (which it already is at "./assets/adaptive-icon.png")
