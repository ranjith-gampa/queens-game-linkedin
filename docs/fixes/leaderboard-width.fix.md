# Leaderboard Width Layout Fix

**Issue ID**: leaderboard-width-fix  
**Date**: June 30, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed  

## Problem Description

The leaderboard table and navigation buttons were expanding beyond the intended container width (page width - 32px), causing the entire page to shift right and break the overall layout. This occurred when:

- Long usernames were displayed in the table
- Navigation buttons with long text were rendered
- The table content exceeded the available horizontal space

## Root Cause Analysis

The primary issue was the use of `w-max` classes on child elements (navigation containers and table) which allowed them to expand beyond their parent container bounds, even when `overflow-hidden` was set on the parent container.

### Technical Details

- **Container**: Used `max-w-[calc(100%-32px)]` which wasn't effectively constraining child elements
- **Navigation**: `w-max` flex containers could expand infinitely
- **Table**: `w-max` table could grow beyond container width
- **Layout Impact**: Child expansion caused parent container to exceed viewport bounds

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Container Constraints
```tsx
// Before (problematic)
<div className="w-full max-w-[calc(100%-32px)] mx-auto ... overflow-hidden">

// After (fixed)
<div className="w-full max-w-[calc(100vw-32px)] mx-auto ... overflow-hidden"
     style={{ maxWidth: 'calc(100vw - 32px)' }}>
```

**Changes:**
- Used viewport width (`100vw`) instead of relative percentage
- Added inline style as fallback for absolute constraint

### 2. Navigation Sections
```tsx
// Before (problematic)
<div className="overflow-x-auto mb-4">
  <div className="flex gap-2 w-max">

// After (fixed)
<div className="overflow-x-auto mb-4 w-full">
  <div className="flex gap-2 min-w-max">
```

**Changes:**
- Replaced `w-max` with `min-w-max` on flex containers
- Added explicit `w-full` to overflow containers
- Maintained `overflow-x-auto` for horizontal scrolling

### 3. Table Layout
```tsx
// Before (problematic)
<div className="overflow-x-auto">
  <table className="w-max">

// After (fixed)
<div className="overflow-x-auto w-full">
  <table className="min-w-full">
```

**Changes:**
- Changed table from `w-max` to `min-w-full`
- Added explicit `w-full` to table's overflow container
- Preserved horizontal scrolling functionality

## Files Modified

### Primary Changes
- `/src/components/Leaderboard/index.tsx`
  - Updated container constraints
  - Fixed navigation button layouts
  - Corrected table width handling

### Related Changes
- `/src/components/LevelSelection/components/LevelsCollection/UngroupedLevelsGrid.tsx`
  - Reduced grid columns from 10 to 9 on small screens (`sm:grid-cols-10` → `sm:grid-cols-9`)

## Technical Insights

### Key Learning
The issue demonstrated that `w-max` allows unlimited expansion which can exceed parent constraints. The solution uses `min-w-max` with explicit `w-full` on containers to ensure content can scroll horizontally within bounds rather than expanding the parent container.

### CSS Behavior
- `w-max`: Allows unlimited width expansion
- `min-w-max`: Sets minimum width to content width but respects parent constraints
- `w-full`: Forces container to use full available width
- `overflow-x-auto`: Enables horizontal scrolling when content exceeds container

## Testing Verification

The fix ensures:
- ✅ Leaderboard never exceeds intended container width
- ✅ Long usernames remain fully visible via horizontal scroll
- ✅ Navigation buttons scroll horizontally when needed
- ✅ No layout shifting occurs on any screen size
- ✅ All content remains accessible and readable

## Prevention Guidelines

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Avoid `w-max` on child elements** when parent has width constraints
2. **Use `min-w-max`** when content needs to determine minimum width
3. **Always pair with `w-full`** on overflow containers
4. **Test with long content** (usernames, button text) during development
5. **Use viewport units (`vw`)** for absolute width constraints
